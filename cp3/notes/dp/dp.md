# Dynamic Programming: 
- overlapping subproblem
- optimal substructure

If a value is used more than once, save the value and just call it later instead of calculating everytime
-> memoization

0 |   Top-Down   | Bottom-Up
---- | --- | -------------
Idea| Big P to Small P  | Stack Small P to solve Big P
method | recursive | iterative
- Approach :
  - Determine what to memo
  - Determine Big P and Small P

  
# Common DP types:
- 0-1 Knapsack :  b3704eb
- Longest Increasing Sum : dd4dfb7
